    <h2>Proposition: Favoring increasing renewable energy production over nonrenewable energy production is more beneficial for strengthening the GDP of the United States.</h2>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Using a dual axis between GDP and each energy production with multiple charts that have a different energy production.
					<ul>
						<li>Earnesty score: 1</li>
						<li>This makes the visualization persuasive because it allows for seeing how the trends directly compare between GDP and energy production. Further, the multiple charts stacked together assist persuasion because they allow readers to easily see the energy production’s effect (or lack thereof) on GDP. Additionally, using the dual axis brought to attention the nonrenewable energy production’s significant drop and the significant spike in renewable energy production on the other plot. What worked well was that the GDP axis was the same for both plots, so the reader did not have to go through any intellectual trouble when comparing between them. Other alternatives I considered were having the three variables separate or the two energy productions together and the GDP by itself, but I settled with this because it was the easiest to understand at first glance.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Using an area graph with consistent colors.
					<ul>
						<li>Earnesty score: 2</li>
						<li>This makes the visualization persuasive because it focuses the readers attention on the fact that the trends are either increasing (in the case of GDP and renewable energy production) or decreasing (in the case of nonrenewable energy production). This worked well because it drew the readers’ eyes towards what to focus on. Another alternative considered was just a line without the area underneath; however, this was not as visually catching or persuasive so that idea was abandoned for the current one.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Truncating the axes to not start at zero.
					<ul>
						<li>Earnesty score: -1</li>
						<li>This was persuasive because if the axes started at zero then there would not be a significant drop in the nonrenewable energy production, nor as big of an increase in renewable energy production. This would have significantly affected the persuasive power behind the visualization since it would look like nonrenewable energy production barely changed at all. Further, keeping the renewable energy axes at max value 8 was necessary to ensure that a considerable trend is visible, otherwise, that would also look insignificant and eliminate the persuasiveness of the visualization.</li>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

				<figcaption>
          Visualization against the proposition.

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Four charts with two plots each; two charts have plots showing a measure of GDP with a plot of energy production (renewable or nonrenewable), and the other two charts also show the energy production but with GDP on the same plot.
					<ul>
						<li>Earnesty score: 0.5</li>
						<li>This is persuasive because it provides different ways to give visualization evidence to support the opposition to the proposition, which would give readers more certainty about the validity of the claim if they could see multiple visualizations that support it. What didn’t work well was that the visualizations were not combined more seamlessly, such as the legends were not combined and the integration of the visualizations was not as seamless as they could have been.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In all the charts, a reversed axis was used for the energy production plots and the GDP plot was not reversed.
					<ul>
						<li>Earnesty score: -2</li>
						<li>This is a highly persuasive design decision because it gives the illusion that GDP is rising while nonrenewable energy production is also rising and renewable energy production is falling. Alternatives considered were to keep the axes not reversed or instead reverse GDP, but these were not implemented because they don’t persuade towards the message I want readers to take with that design.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In the first two charts, GDP is shown as a bar chart with a line showing its trend more clearly and the energy production plots are shown as area plots.
					<ul>
						<li>Earnesty score: -2</li>
						<li>This is persuasive because the area graph draws attention to the white space and makes red/green area seem like a background, which gives the illusion that nonrenewable energy production is increasing and renewable energy production is decreasing. This works very well in the persuasion that increasing nonrenewable energy production and decreasing renewable energy production is beneficial for the country’s GDP. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>All plots are truncated to not start at zero except for the bar plots of the GDP and the renewable energy production plot in the first chart.
					<ul>
						<li>Earnesty score: -2</li>
						<li>This was persuasive because if the axes started at zero then there would not be a significant drop in the nonrenewable energy production, nor as big of an increase in the renewable energy production. This would have significantly affected the persuasive power behind the visualization since it would look like nonrenewable energy production barely changed at all. Further, keeping the renewable energy axes at max value 8 was necessary to ensure that a considerable trend is visible, otherwise, that would also look insignificant and eliminate the persuasiveness of the visualization.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Trend lines are added to the charts with bar plots.
					<ul>
						<li>Earnesty score: -1</li>
						<li>This is persuasive because it shows gives the audience the false impression that nonrenewable energy production is increasing with the GDP as seen by the direction of their trend lines and that renewable energy production is decreasing. This is not the case since the axes are actually reversed for the energy production plots, however, this works well because it might not be noticed at first glance by readers which allows it to yield more persuasion power for supporting its claim. Not including trend lines was considered but this would put the burden of extrapolating the trends and the message themselves, which could be misinterpreted and the message trying to be persuaded might not be picked up.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>&emsp; Overall, the design process for both visualizations went very well and was an enlightening experience. What was straightforward was designing the visualization that supported the proposition. This is because this is the claim that seemed most correct in the data, so I had trouble figuring out how I could develop visualizations to dissuade readers from the proposition. Further, it was difficult to determine which data fields would best fit into the visualization to best persuade readers on both of the claims. However, once I figured out what I had to do and knew the data fields that I knew I should use, it was straightforward to create visualizations that dissuaded against the proposition as well by using techniques from the lectures that we learned were deceptive. What surprised me was the various number of ways I continued to discover to create a deceptive visualization. I did not realize there were many ways I could modify or create visualizations to persuade my claim in that way. <br>
		<br>&emsp; Having completed the assignment, I now define “ethical analysis and visualization” as that which aims to maximize its Earnesty score (where negative numbers of deceptive and positive are earnest design decisions) within the limits of the data it has. For instance, even in my visualization supporting the proposition that was a reasonable claim, I still used a deceptive design decision but it was a higher score than the visualization that aimed to dissuade from the proposition. Going off of that example, I believe that “acceptable” persuasive choices are those that are done to strictly allow for more technical clarity in the claim that is being made in the visualization - readers able to read the visualization easier - as opposed to design decisions which are not strictly necessary from an easy-to-understand perspective and potentially manipulate the message the data is communicating in the visualization.</p>
